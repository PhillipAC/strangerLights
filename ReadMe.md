# Stranger Sounds

## About
Stranger Sounds work with a ardiuno and Maki Maki to display a light 
show when a person stands on a presure plate. The presure plate is 
attached to a Maki Maki which detects it as a space press. The raspberri
pi detects that and sends a signle to the ardinuo which starts playing
a light show while the raspberri pi plays the Stranger Things theme song.
When the Stranger Things theme song is not being played it will play
whatever songs are in the /Music/ directory.
